    "## About this Project\n",
    "In this project, we dive into the vulnerabilities of machine learning models and the difficulties of defending against them. To this end, we ask you to implement an evasion attack (craft adversarial examples) yourselves, and defend your own model.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Note on Grading\n",
    "The total number of points in this project is 100. We further provide the number of points achievable with each excercise. You should take particular care to document and visualize your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever possible, please use tools like tables or figures to compare the different findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Filling-in the Notebook\n",
    "You'll be submitting this very notebook that is filled-in with (all) your code and analysis. Make sure you submit one that has been previously executed in-order. (So that results/graphs are already visible upon opening it). \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook you submit **should compile** (or should be self-contained and sufficiently commented). Check tutorial 1 on how to set up the Python3 environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is extremely important that you **do not** re-order the existing sections. Apart from that, the code blocks that you need to fill-in are given by:\n",
    "```\n",
    "#\n",
    "#\n",
    "# ------- Your Code -------\n",
    "#\n",
    "#\n",
    "```\n",
    "Feel free to break this into multiple-cells. It's even better if you interleave explanations and code-blocks so that the entire notebook forms a readable \"story\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code of Honor\n",
    "We encourage discussing ideas and concepts with other students to help you learn and better understand the course content. However, the work you submit and present **must be original** and demonstrate your effort in solving the presented problems. **We will not tolerate** blatantly using existing solutions (such as from the internet), improper collaboration (e.g., sharing code or experimental data between groups) and plagiarism. If the honor code is not met, no points will be awarded.\n",
